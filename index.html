                    <h1>GitHub Takes Aim at Open Source Software Vulnerabilities</h1>

                    <div class="texto">
                        <p>In September, GitHub acquired the code scanning tool Semmle as part of a plan to help the
                            GitHub community catch common security flaws automatically. Advanced Security includes this
                            service, calling out which line of code contains a potential vulnerability, why it might be
                            exploitable, and how to fix it. In addition to this automatic scanning, Semmle's technology
                            can also be used manually by security researchers. GitHub's goal is to use Advanced Security
                            as both a warning system for developers and a built-in framework for bug hunters to find and
                            report additional issues.</p>

                        <p>GitHub Advanced Security also includes tools that scan user "repositories," essentially the
                            folder where they store their development projects, for secret data like passwords and
                            private keys that shouldn't be exposed and accessible. GitHub works with a number of
                            partners, including Amazon Web Services and Alibaba, to understand the characteristics of
                            their authentication tokens and spot them automatically. The feature has already been
                            available to public repositories for a couple of years, but today GitHub is also adding
                            support to scan private repositories as well. GitHub says that eight percent of active
                            public repositories had a secret exposed in them during the last month alone.</p>

                        <p>
                            With these new tools, GitHub is working to address security issues at a vast scale. Though
                            not all open source projects rely on GitHub, the majority do, and the platform is as much a
                            social network for the community as a development tool. By offering features like Advanced
                            Security, GitHub can create an environment where more projects in the diverse landscape of
                            open source have access to the same types of tools large companies build to improve and
                            safeguard their proprietary code.
                            "The truth is for most maintainers they become maintainers by accident," says GitHub CEO Nat
                            Friedman. "They make something, it becomes widely used and then suddenly they’re in this
                            position of responsibility with regards to computer security—maybe for banks, for
                            governments. They may not have a background in security and yet we have to make sure that
                            the code they publish is secure. So the challenge is to make it automatic and make it
                            natural."
