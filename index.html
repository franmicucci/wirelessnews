                        <p>In September, GitHub acquired the code scanning tool Semmle as part of a plan to help the
                            GitHub community catch common security flaws automatically. Advanced Security includes this
                            service, calling out which line of code contains a potential vulnerability, why it might be
                            exploitable, and how to fix it. In addition to this automatic scanning, Semmle's technology
                            can also be used manually by security researchers. GitHub's goal is to use Advanced Security
                            as both a warning system for developers and a built-in framework for bug hunters to find and
                            report additional issues.

                            GitHub Advanced Security also includes tools that scan user "repositories," essentially the
                            folder where they store their development projects, for secret data like passwords and
                            private keys that shouldn't be exposed and accessible. GitHub works with a number of
                            partners, including Amazon Web Services and Alibaba, to understand the characteristics of
                            their authentication tokens and spot them automatically. The feature has already been
                            available to public repositories for a couple of years, but today GitHub is also adding
                            support to scan private repositories as well. GitHub says that eight percent of active
                            public repositories had a secret exposed in them during the last month alone.</p>
